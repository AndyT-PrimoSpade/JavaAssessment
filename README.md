# JavaAssessment

## Reflections
### What did i like about this project?
Able to explore on the relationship with different classes in Java and better understand how how to make different function work with each other.

### What did you struggle with in this project?
Due to having Covid this period, very hard to focus on the assessment fully as I have miss out on the previous recording and practice. My main struggle will be on how to grade student course and how to disply course passing grade.

### What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Totally is my fault as I was not well during this period to get the experience better. I was not able to see all the recording missed therefore might have some method or function missing.

PS. Did not fully test on different approach to see if all error will occur.
