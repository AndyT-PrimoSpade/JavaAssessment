# JavaAssessment

## Reflections
### What did i like about this project?
Able to explore on the relationship with different classes in Java and better understand how how to make different function work with each other.

### What did you struggle with in this project?
Was having Covid during part of Java lesson and was not able to complete the assessment in time.
Did not have time to explore more feature and reduce error as I was still sick =( but also did not want to delay marking of this assessment.
Real Struggle = Covid >,<

### What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Totally is my fault as I was not well during this period to get the experience better. I was not able to see all the recording missed therefore might have some method or function missing.

PS. Did not fully test on different approach to see if error will occur.
